# CapstoneProjectII
Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 15

Compulsory Task
In this project, you will be creating a simple game. Follow these steps:
● You will need to download pygame. See instructions for this here:
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
● Open the example.py file in the game folder. example.py contains a very
simple game coded with pygame. The player can move up and down
with the arrow keys and must avoid colliding with the ‘enemy’ to win.
Read through the code and comments and run the game to see how to
create a game with pygame.
● Create your own game based on the code in example.py. Your game
should include:
○ One ‘player’ object. You should be able to move the player around
the screen by using the up, down, left and right arrows.
○ At least 3 ‘enemy’ objects. The enemies should all move across the
screen from different positions. If the player object collides with any
enemy object, they lose and the game ends.
○ At least 1 ‘prize’ object. If the player object collides with the prize
object, they win and the game ends.
● Feel free to use the images in this folder or your own images. Remember
to respect copyright laws if you choose to use images from the web.
